# Our Style
Tips and standards for developing user-centered content.

### Abbreviations and acronyms
Abbreviations are any shortened or contracted word or phrase.  For example, writing St. instead of Street, or Rx for prescription, or DC for District of Columbia.
Acronyms are a type of abbreviation.  They shorten phrases in a specific way— using parts of the initial word or phrase (usually letters) to form an abbreviation.  For example, DIY or ASAP.
In the most technical sense, there is a difference between acronyms (abbreviations pronounced as words, like NASA) and initialisms (abbreviations pronounced as letters, like FBI).  For simplicity, our content guide refers to both as acronyms.  The readability issues that acronyms and initialisms create tend to be similar, and “acronym” is the more common term.

#### Acronyms often confuse readers. Avoid them whenever possible.
If an acronym is necessary for future reference, spell the full word and follow with the acronym in parentheses on the first reference.  For example, The General Services Administration (GSA).
Some acronyms are more recognizable than their full spellings.  For example, NASA, NAACP, FBI.  In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable, at the writer’s discretion.
At the writer’s discretion, refer to organizations on second reference with a shortened name instead of an acronym.  For example, use Labor in place of Department of Labor, rather than DOL.

### Active voice
Our writing should be concise and direct.  We prefer the active voice because it supports brevity and makes written content more engaging, too.
The active voice helps the reader identify the subject of the sentence. In the following example, the person who submits the form is essential information.  Omitting that leads to a confusing and impersonal sentence.
- Passive:  The request form must be submitted to the approving official.
- Active:  You must submit the request form to the approving official.

Along with deemphasizing who should take an action, the passive voice is usually longer, too.  Wordy instructions are harder to follow.
- Passive:  The case number should be saved in your records. It will be required for future inquiries.
- Active:  Save the case number in your records.  You will need it for future inquiries.

When in doubt, cut directly to the verb and give the reader clear directions.

#### How to recognize the passive voice
Use of the passive voice is common enough that many people don’t notice when they use it.  Here’s a simple way to recognize it, courtesy of Dr. Rebecca Johnson: If you insert “by zombies” after the verb and the sentence still makes sense, you’re using the passive voice.

#### When to use the passive voice
Never use the passive voice in a way that makes actions seem like they happen without anyone doing them.
You may occasionally need to use the passive voice to soften an error message or make something easier to understand.
Rewording either of these sentences to use the active voice would complicate the sentence or pull focus away from its main point:
Forms issued by the Office of Government Ethics include the OGE-450 and the OGE-278.
The agency is required to respond to requests within 20 working days.

### Capitalization
Follow a consistent capitalization scheme.
Creating trustworthy internal and external communications relies, to a large extent, on the content’s consistency.  Inconsistent spellings and capitalizations undermine your narrative authority. We follow these capitalization guidelines:
- Do capitalize proper nouns, including names of individuals, places, and agencies
- Don’t capitalize agile, unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Don’t capitalize open source, unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Don’t capitalize federal or government

When you’re deciding whether to capitalize noun phrases, keep in mind that in English, title case is often a marker of formality.  Using it judiciously can help clarify that you’re speaking about a specific, official thing (such as a form, office, or person).  Overuse can cause users stress by implying formality or officialness where it doesn’t exist. For instance:
- It makes sense to capitalize the phrase Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return because you want users to know the exact, official title of that specific form.
- It could confuse users to capitalize income taxes or income tax forms, because those phrases could refer to any number of possible forms.

See additional capitalization rules in the Specific words and phrases section.

#### Personal titles
Don’t capitalize personal titles unless they precede a name. For example, the director got approval or Director Lopez got approval. Whenever possible, keep titles gender neutral.  For example, we prefer firefighter to fireman and chairperson to chairman.

#### Headings
Headlines, page titles, subheads and similar content should follow sentence case, and should not include a trailing colon.  For example:
Making sense of Washington’s tech landscape
Privileges and responsibilities
See also: information about optimizing headings.

### Inclusive language
The words we use can make the difference between forging positive connections or creating distance in our personal and professional lives. Particularly in writing, impact is more important than intent.
As we build government services, we want to ensure they are accessible and welcoming to everyone who needs to use them.  Inclusive language helps us to be more accurate and build trust with our users.
This guidance is influenced by the Conscious Style Guide, which is an excellent resource for learning more about the conversations behind terms, categories, and concepts. Other resources we used:
- Diversity Style Guide
- Disability Language Style Guide
- Associated Press Stylebook
- Syracuse University Disability Cultural Center Language Guide

This page is not exhaustive, but aims to provide principles, resources, and specific suggestions for writing and talking about diverse groups of people.

#### Ability and disability
Every person is a whole person — no matter how they interact with the world. Focus on what they need to do, what tools they use, and avoid making assumptions.  If a person’s situation, medical condition, illness, or injury is relevant to the content, be as specific as possible and avoid inserting value judgements about their circumstance (for example, use has multiple sclerosis, not is afflicted with or suffers from).
Just like with language around race, gender, or other identities, it’s always best to ask people how they identify rather than assuming.  For help finding appropriate or accurate language, see the Disability Language Style Guide from the National Center on Disability and Journalism.
- Avoid describing people as disabled, handicapped, or confined to a wheelchair.
- Avoid terms that contribute to stigmas around disability or mental illness: crazy, dumb, lame, insane, psycho, schizophrenic, or stupid.
- Avoid terms that contribute to stigmas around sensory disabilities: blind spot or tone deaf.

#### Age
Avoid referring to someone’s age, unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing about (for example, when referring to benefits that are available to people of certain ages).
- Don’t use women or older relatives as substitute for novice or beginner.  For example, don’t say something is so simple your mother can use it.
- We prefer older person or senior to elderly.

### Gender and sexuality
Make content gender neutral wherever possible, and strive to write in a gender-fair way.  If you’re writing about a hypothetical person or if you’re unsure of the person’s pronouns, use they or them instead of he/she.
Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias, such as irrelevant descriptions of appearance.
Use descriptors of gender identity or sexual orientation as modifiers, not as nouns (for example, transgender person, cisgender person, or lesbian woman).  Avoid guessing sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.  When in doubt, either reconsider the need to include this information or ask the person you’re referring to how they identify and what terms they prefer.
- Use different sex instead of opposite sex (because this recognizes gender as a spectrum, rather than a binary).
- We support using they or their as singular pronouns.
- Avoid guys as a way to refer to mixed-gender groups.
- Don’t make assumptions about marital or family relationships (for example, use spouse or partner instead of husband and wife; use parent instead of mother and father).

For more detailed guidance, see the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association Style Guide or the GLAAD Media Reference Guide.

#### Nationality
Avoid using citizen as a generic term for people who live in the United States.  Many government programs serve non-citizens and individuals with a wide range of immigration and visa statuses.
- How you refer to the public is largely dependent on context.  Feel free to choose from any of these words:  people, the public, users, or folks.
- Be as specific as possible.  Depending on the situation, you may want to say something like people who need healthcare or people who need to access government services online.
- Use citizens for information related to U.S. citizenship, for example, when describing who is eligible to vote in federal elections.
- Be careful with Americans or the American public. These terms are ambiguous and are often used as synonyms for citizens. 

In most cases, the public is equally clear and more inclusive. That said, referring to Americans or the American people can be useful if you want to inspire readers or take a more patriotic tone.

#### Race, ethnicity, and religion
Avoid using words, images, or situations that reinforce racial, ethnic, or religious stereotypes (even stereotypes that may appear to be positive). Avoid the term non-white, or other terms that treat whiteness as a default.
Don’t make assumptions: ask how people identify themselves, and be aware of complexities within racial, ethnic, and religious identities.  For example, not all Arabs are Muslim, and many nationalities and ethnicities include various religious practices and traditions.
When referring to a person’s race or ethnicity, use adjectives, not nouns (for example, a Hispanic person, not a Hispanic).

#### Media style guides for race, ethnicity, and religion

- Asian American Journalists Association Handbook
- Native American Journalists Association Reporter’s Indigenous Terminology Guide
- Religion Newswriters Association’s Religion Stylebook

### Names

#### Personal names
Use full names on first reference.  On second reference, use first names when writing about our teams or our work, and otherwise follow AP style (which is to mostly use last names on second reference).
If the context means that there’s a chance of confusion on second reference when using only first or last names, use full names.

#### State names
- Spell out state names, such as Mississippi.
- When referring to a number of states, “state” should be lowercase. For example, All 50 states responded.
- When used with a city, spell out the name of the state.  For example, Atlanta, Georgia.

### Numbers and percentages

#### Numbers
Generally speaking, we follow the guidelines outlined in the AP Stylebook.  In body copy, we prefer to spell out numbers one through nine, and use numerals for numbers 10 and greater.  This is true of ordinal numbers, as well. Spell out first to ninth, and capture 10th or greater with numerals.
Sometimes the government writes about very large numbers:  millions, billions, even trillions.  We express these numbers with a numeral and a word. For example, 1.6 million people.  When referring to amounts of money in cents or greater than $1 million, we use numerals followed by words: 5 cents or $2.7 million.  For amounts of money less than $1 million, we use the dollar sign: $17.
In titles, subheadings, and interface labels, we use numerals instead of spelling out numbers.  For example, 10 digital tech leaders you should know now or 6 ways to incorporate plain-language strategies.  We do this to promote ease of reading and scannability — in titles and headings, it’s easier for readers to scan numerals than it is for them to scan written-out numbers.

#### Dates
Use the full, four-digit year.  For informal writing, it’s okay to use an abbreviated form. For example, We’re thankful web design isn’t stuck in the ’90s.

#### Percentages
In keeping with AP style, we spell out percent in most cases, with a few exceptions. We use the percent sign (%) in these circumstances:
Tables and in technical or scientific writing.  For example: 60% of participants reported experiencing negative side effects.
Headings and subheadings.  For example: Candidate Woof takes 7% lead in the election for best dog.
Interface labels
Captions and infographics
We choose to use the percent sign in these cases to improve content’s scannability, allowing readers to digest the content more quickly.

### Punctuation

#### Bulleted lists
Capitalize the first word of every bullet.  Don’t use semicolons after points in a bulleted list.  Include a period at the end of the bullet only if that point is a complete sentence.  For example:
When you go to the store, please buy:
- Apples
- Bananas
- Naan chips

When you leave the house:
- Please buy apples, bananas, and naan chips.
- Fill the car with gas.

#### Colons
Capitalize the first word after a colon, only if what follows is a complete sentence.  For example:
I have several favorite foods:  apples, bananas, and naan chips.
I have several favorite foods:  Apples were my first favorite snack, but naan chips are a rising star in my life.
#### Commas
We use the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford comma).  In a list of three or more, include a comma before the conjunction.  For example:  Please buy apples, bananas, and naan chips.

#### Dashes
When offsetting a phrase with dashes you should use the longer em dash (—), which is Option + Shift + - on Macs, with a space on either side of the dash.  For example:
We emphasize open, digital record keeping, and — whenever possible — we illuminate our processes.
Although we advocate using words rather than symbols, in some contexts you may use an “en dash” to convey a range of numbers.  For example, both 10–20 students and 10 to 20 students are acceptable options.  En dash is Option + - on Macs.
We assign 2–3 people to each development team.

#### Quotes
These quotations are correctly punctuated:
“Would you like a banana?” he asked.
“I hate bananas,” she said. “You know I hate bananas.”
He paused before saying “bananas are not something people should hate.”

#### Spaces
Sentences should always be separated by a single space.  Never two spaces.

#### Ampersands or plus signs
Use and instead of an ampersand or plus sign, unless they’re part of an official title or company name.  For example, D.C. Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day

#### Slashes
Avoid using the slash / symbol.  Replace it with words or commas as appropriate.

### Specific words and phrases

### Voice and tone
If you’re like many folks, you might not be sure of the difference between voice and tone.  Maybe you’ve never deliberately crafted a voice and don’t know where to start.  Not to fret!  In this section, we’ll discuss the differences between voice and tone, how we describe our organizational voice, how to establish your own voice, and how to choose a tone that’s appropriate for whatever you’re writing.

#### The difference between voice and tone
It’s a common question and one that young writers find themselves asking often:  What’s the difference between voice and tone?
Our voice is our unique personality.  It can be helpful to think of voice as analogous to a person’s voice.  Just as you can identify your best friend in a crowd as soon as you hear her distinctive laugh, you can use an author’s or organization’s voice to identify a piece of writing even if you haven’t seen the byline.  A well-crafted voice communicates personality and values — it’s a distilled representation of an author or organization.
Tone is more like attitude — the emotional context of a piece.  It can be helpful to think of authorial tone as analogous to a person’s tone of voice.  Just as a person would use a somber, sympathetic tone of voice to console a friend about the loss of a pet, an author writing a story about a natural disaster would most likely use a somber, serious tone. Conversely, an author writing a blog post about the launch of a new product might use an enthusiastic, upbeat tone.

#### Our voice
At Defions, we like to communicate in a friendly, straightforward way. We consider our voice to be:
- Authoritative
- Conversational
- Friendly
- Instructive
- Welcoming to all audiences

We believe that government communication can — and should — be fun and easy to read, and our voice represents this.
Here are a few sentences, taken from this content guide, that exemplify our voice:
```markdown
We created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis.  It’s here when you’re wondering whether to capitalize the word federal, for instance, or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone.
```

#### Use contractions
In all of the communication we produce, we want to create a strong connection with our users.  We want to get them the information they need in a straightforward way and show that we know what’s important to them.  As a vendor for government organizations, we need to sound somewhat official; we also recognize that official doesn’t need to translate to stuffy, archaic, or aloof.
For this reason, we use contractions in the writing we create for our site.  We also encourage clients to consider using contractions, too, though we recognize this may not be the right choice for all contexts.
The government is run by people for the benefit of people, and we never want users to forget that Defions is a group of enthusiastic, dedicated, hardworking (and friendly) folks.  This desire informs how we craft our voice.

#### Establishing your own voice
Whether you realize it or not, you already have a unique voice; the tricky part can be classifying it and pinning it down.
To describe your voice — which, in turn, will allow you to diagram it, create guidelines around it, and make it reproducible — you’ll need to do some investigation and self reflection.  Ask yourself these questions:

#### What are my core values?  
Your voice is a reflection of your core values. Before you craft a voice, consider the values your organization represents and how you can translate these into stylistic patterns.  If you’re part of a young organization that hasn’t yet codified its values, you might use this opportunity to start that conversation.  Crafting a voice before you’ve determined your organization’s values can be dangerous — your voice might not reflect what you eventually decide on.  Along the same lines, if your organization is undergoing a large-scale values overhaul, you’ll want to make sure your organizational voice reflects your new values.

#### Who is my audience?  
In writing, as elsewhere, your audience is paramount — without them, you’d have no reason to write.  Put yourself in their situation and think about the stylistic traits that might appeal to them.  Remember, your voice doesn’t need to appeal to everyone (and, in fact, shouldn’t — cure-alls cure nothing, as the old saying goes).
Use your answers to these questions to craft a description of your voice. Once you’ve come up with your description, look it over and identify any contradictions or holes (never a good thing).  While voices should be nuanced, they should also be cohesive.

#### Choosing a tone
As we mentioned earlier, your voice is a constant, but your tone is a variable.  Consider the following:  If you’re having an irredeemably terrible day, you might get peeved at a store associate who chirpily (and repeatedly) asks if they can help you with anything.  Instead of picking up on your nonverbal — or perhaps verbal — cues, this associate is tone-deaf.  The associate maintained a consistently helpful voice, but they failed to shift their tone from energetic to restrained.  As a result, their message (however valuable or well-intended) is lost on you.
To avoid going the way of the associate, think about your users’ needs in different situations.  Use these needs to determine your tone.
Let’s consider three examples that target three different reader groups. Obituaries, technical blog posts, and marketing emails targeted at newly engaged couples have vastly different tones.  Why?  The three types of writing correspond to audiences in three highly different emotional states.

## NEED TO FIX
Type of writing	Intended readership	Tone	Example
Obituary of a prominent community member	People who knew (or knew of) the deceased	Respectful, reverent, somber	“Professor Pelham was respected by his colleagues and revered by students, many of whom would wake before dawn on registration day to ensure gaining entry to his classes. His wit, gentle humor, and compassion left their mark on everyone he talked to.”
Blog post announcing open source documentation guide	Developers and other readers with a strong tech background	Direct, impartial	“The Open Source Style Guide is a comprehensive handbook for writing clear, accessible, and user-friendly documentation so that your open source code repositories are accessible both internally and externally.
Marketing email from the boutique bridal department of a well-known clothing company	Newly engaged women (ages 28 through 33)	Enthusiastic, earnest, bubbly	“Say ‘I do!’ to 25% off. Now through July 3rd, take an additional 25% off all bridal wear and accessories. Celebrate your big day in style (and get a jumpstart on your honeymoon fund!).”

If you’re having trouble finding an appropriate tone, try reframing the situation:  How would you talk to a friend who’s in the same situation as your target user?  Remembering that written communication is a conversation can help you settle on the best tone for your purpose.

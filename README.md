# Content Guide 

## Introduction

### How to use this guide
This guide was developed for colleagues of Defions Solutions. 

### Overview
This guide helps writers create content that’s easy to understand and meets people where they are.  Government websites often talk at readers rather than to or with end-users.  As with other facets of its online presence, .gov writing tends to describe the government’s concerns in “governmentese,” leaving users frustrated by information that is neither actionable nor understandable.
This guide takes that frustration into account, as well as several commonly supported guidelines about writing for the web.  Using this guide can help content designers benefit from our experience to date, incorporate user feedback into the editorial process, and build trust by communicating in a consistent manner.

### If you work at Defions Solutions
We created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis.  It’s here when you’re wondering whether to capitalize the word federal, for instance or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone.

## Resources
We adapted this guide from GOV.UK’s work, and we’d like to thank their content team for championing plain language and information accessibility.

## Our Approach
Tips and standards for developing user-centered content.

### Content principles

#### Start with user needs.
Write in a way that suits the situation. Ask yourself: Who is going to read this? What do they need to know? How might they be feeling?
Help people find the information they need quickly and easily. Guide them through the process.

#### Do the hard work to make it simple.
Use plain language and simple sentences.
Choose clarity over cleverness.

#### Write for everyone.
Respect the complexity of our users’ experiences.
Be willing to be surprised about who’s reading your work.

#### Build trust.
Talk like a person.
Tell the truth.
Use positive language and concrete examples.

#### Start small and iterate.
Make sure your content works for users. Don’t be afraid to scrap what’s there and start over.
Write a draft, test it out, gather feedback, and keep refining.

### Address the user
Content on government sites often makes a direct appeal to the public to get involved or take action.
Address the user as you whenever possible. For example:
You can email us at info@defions.ai or find us on Twitter.
Learn more about starting your account.
If you’re creating content for multiple users—such as patients and their caregivers—address the primary user as you and refer to secondary users by their roles or titles.
We recommend against using the word citizens when talking about the public.

### Avoid duplication
If something is written once and links to relevant information easily and well, people are more likely to trust the content.  Duplicate content produces poor search results, confuses the user, and damages the credibility of our websites.
If users can find two similar pieces of content on a subject, they might end up calling a helpline or sending an email to the first address they find because they aren’t sure they have the right information.
There are thousands of federal websites.  Collectively, they host hundreds of millions of pieces of content.  What are you writing about? What are other agencies publishing?  Are users across the country and the world seeing a coherent view? How are we different?
Before you publish something, check that the user needs you’re trying to address has not already been covered:
- Search for the content using a popular search engine like Google or Bing.  This is how most users will start, too.  If content is already easy to find, duplicating it can lead us to compete with ourselves for search results.
_ Often, Defions team members write about a government service, tool, or program.  Think authoritatively:  What department or agency controls the thing you’re writing about?  What information have they produced already?
- Start significant projects with a content audit.  Identify how any existing information is used and whether it will be helpful to your users in its current state.  If it isn’t, what must change for it to help you address your users’ needs?  Focus your work on those changes.

### Be concise
To keep content understandable, concise, and relevant, it should be:
- Specific
- Informative
- Clear and concise
- Brisk but not terse
- Incisive (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and unnecessary words) but human (not something generated by a faceless machine)
- Serious but not pompous or emotionless—adjectives can be subjective and make the text sound more emotive and like spin
You should:
- Use contractions (such as can’t and won’t)
- Not let caveats dictate unwieldy grammar (for example, say You can rather than You may be able to)
- Use the language people are using
- Use Google Trends to check for common search terms
- Use short sentences
- Check sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them for clarity

Words ending in –ion and -ment tend to make sentences longer and more complicated than necessary.  Avoid turning verbs into nouns, a common sign of governmentese at work.

#### Keep sentences short and sweet
Craft sentences at 25 words or fewer, whenever possible.  If a sentence has fewer than 14 words, readers understand 90 percent of content.  At 25 words, sentences are markedly more difficult to comprehend.

We also recommend varying sentence length.  Switching things up helps you keep readers interested.  This tactic will also give you better control of your content’s tone — a text with only short sentences can unintentionally sound terse.  The occasional longer sentence adds a bit of narrative interest (and can help a piece of writing sound friendlier, too).

Here’s an example of how you might transform a too-long sentence into something more manageable.  Instead of:
- Due to privacy and logistical considerations, passes cannot be replaced if lost or stolen; a new Paper Voucher must be accessed by going to the everykidinapark.gov website and completing the same activities to obtain a new Paper Voucher.
Use:
- Unfortunately, we can’t replace lost or stolen passes.  Get a new pass by visiting everykidinapark.gov and signing up again.

### Use plain language
U.S. government websites are for everyone.  The content they contain should be as straightforward as possible.
One of the best ways to make content clear and usable is to use plain language.  When we use words people understand, our content is more findable, accessible, and inclusive.  Plain language is also mandatory for all federal government websites.
When we use jargon in our writing, we risk losing users’ trust. Government, legal, business jargon are often vague or unfamiliar to users, and can lead to misinterpretation.
Another temptation that can hurt readability is figurative language: it often doesn’t say what you actually mean, and can make your content more difficult to understand.  For example:
- drive (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
- drive out (unless it’s cattle)
- going forward (unless you’re giving directions)
- one-stop shop (we’re the government, not a big box store)

In most cases, you can avoid these figures of speech by describing what you’re actually doing. Be open and specific.
If you’re struggling to use plain language, try writing conversationally. Picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-on-one, with the authority of someone who can actively help.

#### Don’t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do.  
Use buy instead of purchase, help instead of assist, about instead of approximately, and so on.
Plain language lists can help spot problem words and consider alternatives, but keep in mind that plain language is more than just a list of words to avoid—it’s a way of writing.

#### Words to avoid
- agenda (unless you’re talking about a meeting)
- advancing
- collaborate (use working with)
- combating (use working against or fighting)
- commit or pledge (we need to be more specific — we’re either doing something or we’re not)
- countering (use answering or responding)
- deliver (pizzas, mail, and services are delivered — not abstract concepts like improvements or priorities)
- deploy (unless you’re talking about the military or software)
- dialogue (we speak to people)
- disincentivize or incentivize
- empower
- execute (use run or do)
- facilitate (instead, say something specific about how you are helping)
- focusing
- foster (unless it’s children)
- illegals or illegal aliens (use undocumented immigrants)
- impact or impactful
- initiate (use start)
- innovative (use words that describe the positive outcome of the innovation)
- in order to (use to)
- key (unless it unlocks something, use important or omit)
- land (as a verb only use if you’re talking about aircraft)
- leverage (unless you use it in the financial sense)
- liaise (use collaborate, work with, or partner with)
- modify (use change instead)
- overarching
- progress (what are you actually doing?)
- promote (unless you’re talking about an ad campaign or some other marketing promotion)
- robust
- simple or simply (use straightforward, uncomplicated, or clear, or leave the descriptor out altogether)
- slimming down (processes don’t diet)
- streamline
- strengthening (unless you’re referring to bridges or other structures)
- tackling (unless you’re referring to football or another contact sport)
- thought leader (refer to a person’s accomplishments)
- touchpoint (mention specific system components)
- transforming (what are you actually doing to change it?)
- user testing (use user research or usability testing)
- utilize (use use)

#### When to use legal and technical terms
Present complicated information clearly so it’s easier to understand. If you need to include legal terms or technical language, include a short, plain-language summary or define your terms up front.
It’s fine to use technical terms when they’re appropriate for the audience or the situation, but you need to explain what they mean on the first reference.
If you’re publishing source code, see the Defions Style Guide for tips on making the project easy to use and understand.

### Structure the content
Below you’ll find a few characteristics of online readers as well as our recommendations on ways to keep them in mind when writing and editing.

#### Important information first
Online, users tend to scan text until they find the information they need. No matter how carefully you craft your content, most people will only read 25 percent of it.  This statistic isn’t meant to dishearten; rather, we believe it underscores the importance of getting content right.
Put the most important information in the first two paragraphs.  That’s the section users are most likely to read. In journalism, this technique is called the “inverted pyramid.”

#### Break up text
Large chunks of text can overwhelm readers.  Use subheads and bullet points; they provide clear narrative structure for readers in a hurry.  Put information-carrying words at the beginning of the phrase, and use the active voice.
Instead of:
- Looking into the regulation of campaign finances
Use:
- Campaign finance law explained

If you’re wrangling a lot of data, tables can help you visualize that content.  Long paragraphs cluttered with numbers or dates are more difficult to scan than, for example:
## NEED TO FIX
Report type  |  Dates covered  |  Due
Quarterly (Form 3, 3Z, 3L)  |  January 1–March 31  |  April 15
April 1–June 30	July 15
July 1–September 30	October 15
October 1–December 31	January 31

#### Don’t use FAQs
Like our peers at GDS, we strongly discourage writing FAQs, or Frequently Asked Questions.
FAQs:
- Are hard to read and search for
- Duplicate other content on your site
- Are usually not questions asked by the public
- Mean that content is not where people expect to find it—it needs to be in context

If you’re thinking about posting FAQs, review the related content on your site and look for ways to improve it.  Take the necessary steps to give users the best possible experience.
Ask yourself:
- Is the content organized in a logical way?
- Can you group similar topics together?
- Is it easy to find the right answer?
- Is it clear and up-to-date?

If people are asking similar questions, the existing content isn’t meeting their needs.  Perhaps you need to rewrite it or combine several pieces of content. Pay attention to what users are asking for and find the best way to guide them through the process.

### Keep refining
Content design is an ongoing process, and even published content isn’t really “done,” in a traditional sense — it’s not a static entity.  To ensure that your content is helping users, you need to keep refining it over time.
When you’re creating content, it’s best to base your refinements on insights from users.  This section addresses ways to test your content’s effectiveness and includes tips for archiving and deleting content without disrupting the user experience.

#### Testing and ongoing research
Set aside time regularly to make sure your content works for users.  If you’re not sure where to start, check your web analytics to identify:
- Pages with high or low traffic
- Pages with high or low reading times
- Common search terms
- Common user flows within your site

You can also review:
- User feedback from surveys, call center logs, and support emails
- Recurring themes from channels like Twitter, Facebook, and tech blogs

You should make a habit of listening to users, too.  Conduct usability testing sessions regularly to understand how people access, use, and interpret key pieces of content on your site.

### Archiving and deleting content
You may occasionally need to archive or delete outdated content.  Maybe it’s irrelevant after a recent policy change or redundant with other pages on your site.  Avoid moving or deleting content without a good reason, because it can cause a lot of frustration for users.  Changes to site structure may also slow down users who’ve learned specific navigation paths on your site.
As part of ongoing site maintenance, you should audit your content to keep everything updated and identify potential duplication.  Depending on the size of your site, you may want to review everything on a yearly basis, for example, or look at one or two sections at a time.
Before you archive or delete anything, review your site analytics to understand how users are accessing the content now, and check in with the content owner or author to come up with a plan together.  Be sure to consider cases that may not show up in analytics data too, such as:
- Search engine results
- User bookmarks
- Links from external sites

Each of these can be addressed by ensuring you have redirects from the old URLs to the latest content.
When you’re looking at a particular page, think about the best way to meet user needs:
- Who is this content for?
- Is there a legal requirement for having it?
- How often do people visit this page?
- Are there any incoming links to it, either within your site or from popular referrers?
- Are there other pages that cover this topic? Can you combine them? Which one shows up higher in search results?
- Can you hide or archive the page instead of deleting it?
- Was this content meant to expire quickly? Was the website the right channel for this type of content — or should posts like this move to a blog, newsletter, or social media account in the future?

If you genuinely need to delete something, give users a path to find what they need.  This could include:
- URL redirects
- Ceding ownership of the content to another organization who can maintain it
- Keeping content around and adding context that it is depreciated or no longer maintained
- Making the content available elsewhere with an archiving service like the National Archives and Records Administration’s Government Web Harvests or the Internet Archive
- Custom 404 pages to help users find what they’re looking for

### Giving and receiving feedback
Giving and receiving feedback on writing is hard.  Both need your time, energy, and care.  That may feel daunting.  But we all want our work to be strong and it only gets better with feedback.
The beauty of the writing process is that it’s iterative — everyone (yes, everyone) writes crappy first drafts.  The important thing is to share the draft, gather feedback, revise, and repeat.  Even published content isn’t really “done.”  It’s important to keep refining, and incorporating feedback from your readers is part of that process.
Here are some ways to approach giving and receiving writing feedback.

#### How to give feedback
Start by reading the piece in its entirety before editing or making comments.  Though you may be tempted to give line edits on an early draft, resist this temptation!  It’s likely that much of the text will change from draft to draft, so your line-editing work may be lost by the final draft. Focus on the central goal or message of the piece—not specific wording or stylistic decisions.  If you find yourself needing to comment on structural issues or key messages, it’s probably worth setting up a meeting to talk through things.
As you read, think about the answers to the following questions:
- Is it clear?
- Is it easy to follow?
- Are there any gaps or places you get lost?
- How might someone feel after reading this?
- Does it leave you with any questions?
- Are there any places that could use a story or concrete examples?
- Does it assume knowledge that the reader might not have?

Respond as a reader and tell the writer:
- What doesn’t feel right
- What doesn’t make sense
- What isn’t working — and what is!
- What you want to know more or less about, and why
- What questions you have
- What doesn’t reflect your own experience

Ask questions to help the writer revise:
- Who is the audience?
- Why does this matter?
- What does this mean?
- How does this help the reader?
- What’s the most important thing for people to understand?
- What do we want readers to do next?

When people ask for feedback, they’re looking for your thoughts on what aspects of their work could be stronger.  Even as you offer kindly worded suggestions for improvement, it’s nice to comment on what’s working in a piece, too.  Everyone likes to receive recognition for what they’ve done well.  Plus, you don’t want them to unknowingly change what’s working — sharing positive feedback can prevent them from doing so.
Everyone needs feedback, even professional writers.  Don’t second-guess yourself as the reader. You don’t have to have the solution or right answer.  Ask questions, let the writer know if something doesn’t make sense, and tell them what you like.  Finally, thank them for asking for your feedback. It’s not easy, and it shows that they care about the work and their reader.

#### How to receive feedback
It’s natural to feel timid about sharing your work, especially if it’s an early draft.  But sharing work early in the writing process has great benefits.  Your colleagues can help you identify the strengths and weaknesses of your piece, which can help you narrow your focus and determine which sections need the most work.  Likewise, your colleagues can point out interesting areas that you could expand on.
If you’re apprehensive about sharing your work, it can be helpful to label documents as drafts to help frame your readers’ expectations and perceptions.  For example: ‘First draft: Giving feedback on writing.’ Sharing drafts with one person, rather than a larger group, can also help you ease into the process.
First, be clear about the type of feedback you’re looking for to ensure you get comments that are useful for the stage of writing you’re in. Here’s a summary of some types of feedback you can ask for and at what stage:
- Collaborative:  These are some initial rough ideas—feel free to dig in and change anything.
- High-level edits:  Observations about a piece’s general concept, structure, and intent — are most useful for early drafts.  Are the big ideas coming through? Does the structure make sense? Is the flow logical?
- Line edits:  Better suited to later, more finalized drafts, whose ideas are fleshed out and which could benefit from some polish. How’s the voice and tone? Is the writing clear and consistent? What doesn’t make sense?
- Copyediting:  We’re about to publish this — are there typos or awkward phrases?

If your piece needs additional context, share it.  There are all types of context that might be helpful: background information, strategies that have been tried in the past (and since abandoned), any legal considerations, audience needs or insights from research, or variations between our house style and a client’s content conventions.
If you have a deadline, be honest and realistic about it.  And if you’re unsure about how long it will take your reader to give feedback, be honest about that, too — it’s OK to ask them whether your expectations align with their timeframe.
Lastly, show appreciation.  Giving feedback takes time and energy. Thank the person for taking the time to read your piece and share their thoughtful observations.  Consider sharing the end result with them so they can see how their feedback helped you.

### Make content web-friendly
One of the simplest ways to present accessible, maintainable information online is to use HTML.
It can be tempting to choose file formats that are more convenient for the author, such as PDF or Word.  However, presenting content in PDF, Word, or similar formats can make content much harder to use.
Therefore, we strongly recommend using HTML for all web content. Here are some of the benefits:
- It’s much easier to link to specific pages or sections of HTML pages.
- It’s much easier to update and maintain HTML content.
- HTML content avoids breaking the user out of their browsing flow, and maintains the context of the site’s navigation and structure. Conversely, this often means that HTML pages are easier to re-find and less likely to be “orphaned” or left online beyond their usefulness.
- All web content should be accessible, and this is much easier to accomplish and enforce with HTML content. It is possible to create accessible PDFs, but requires significant specialized training and effort for each document.
- HTML content is generally more accessible to search engines, and even within a page, HTML content is often more searchable and scannable for users seeking specific information.
- HTML content is much more responsive-friendly (especially on responsive websites), and some systems don’t display PDFs within the browser.  This makes for a confusing user experience and may cause some users to be unable to view or find the PDF at all.

Here are some alternate approaches for situations in which people often choose PDFs:
- When the content includes images, tables, or other graphics that you aren’t sure how to display in existing page templates:  Instead, work with a designer or your web publishing team to explore how you can translate the information you need into native web content.
- Formal or policy documents that are infrequently or never updated:  Instead of using PDF to convey permanence, use document structure, clear timestamps, and design cues to help users understand the context they need to interpret the document.
- Manuals or other long documents:  These are especially crucial to make available as HTML content, especially because they often need to be kept up-to-date as technology or processes change.  If you expect users to need offline access, support PDF as an alternate format or ensure clean, useful print stylesheets so that users can generate their own PDF.

PDF-first may be the appropriate choice for content that’s primarily and only intended for print use.  This might include brochures, business cards, or forms that must submitted as paper copies. (Though a better long-term approach is to change forms and processes so people can submit soft copies or complete the form online.)
If you do choose to present content in PDF, remember to ensure the information is also available on your website in an accessible, linkable, and responsive HTML format.
Avoid using formats for which users need specific, proprietary software (for instance, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Pages).


## Our Style
Tips and standards for developing user-centered content.

### Abbreviations and acronyms
Abbreviations are any shortened or contracted word or phrase.  For example, writing St. instead of Street, or Rx for prescription, or DC for District of Columbia.
Acronyms are a type of abbreviation.  They shorten phrases in a specific way— using parts of the initial word or phrase (usually letters) to form an abbreviation.  For example, DIY or ASAP.
In the most technical sense, there is a difference between acronyms (abbreviations pronounced as words, like NASA) and initialisms (abbreviations pronounced as letters, like FBI).  For simplicity, our content guide refers to both as acronyms.  The readability issues that acronyms and initialisms create tend to be similar, and “acronym” is the more common term.

#### Acronyms often confuse readers. Avoid them whenever possible.
If an acronym is necessary for future reference, spell the full word and follow with the acronym in parentheses on the first reference.  For example, The General Services Administration (GSA).
Some acronyms are more recognizable than their full spellings.  For example, NASA, NAACP, FBI.  In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable, at the writer’s discretion.
At the writer’s discretion, refer to organizations on second reference with a shortened name instead of an acronym.  For example, use Labor in place of Department of Labor, rather than DOL.

### Active voice
Our writing should be concise and direct.  We prefer the active voice because it supports brevity and makes written content more engaging, too.
The active voice helps the reader identify the subject of the sentence. In the following example, the person who submits the form is essential information.  Omitting that leads to a confusing and impersonal sentence.
- Passive:  The request form must be submitted to the approving official.
- Active:  You must submit the request form to the approving official.

Along with deemphasizing who should take an action, the passive voice is usually longer, too.  Wordy instructions are harder to follow.
- Passive:  The case number should be saved in your records. It will be required for future inquiries.
- Active:  Save the case number in your records.  You will need it for future inquiries.

When in doubt, cut directly to the verb and give the reader clear directions.

#### How to recognize the passive voice
Use of the passive voice is common enough that many people don’t notice when they use it.  Here’s a simple way to recognize it, courtesy of Dr. Rebecca Johnson: If you insert “by zombies” after the verb and the sentence still makes sense, you’re using the passive voice.

#### When to use the passive voice
Never use the passive voice in a way that makes actions seem like they happen without anyone doing them.
You may occasionally need to use the passive voice to soften an error message or make something easier to understand.
Rewording either of these sentences to use the active voice would complicate the sentence or pull focus away from its main point:
Forms issued by the Office of Government Ethics include the OGE-450 and the OGE-278.
The agency is required to respond to requests within 20 working days.

### Capitalization
Follow a consistent capitalization scheme.
Creating trustworthy internal and external communications relies, to a large extent, on the content’s consistency.  Inconsistent spellings and capitalizations undermine your narrative authority. We follow these capitalization guidelines:
- Do capitalize proper nouns, including names of individuals, places, and agencies
- Don’t capitalize agile, unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Don’t capitalize open source, unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Don’t capitalize federal or government

When you’re deciding whether to capitalize noun phrases, keep in mind that in English, title case is often a marker of formality.  Using it judiciously can help clarify that you’re speaking about a specific, official thing (such as a form, office, or person).  Overuse can cause users stress by implying formality or officialness where it doesn’t exist. For instance:
- It makes sense to capitalize the phrase Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return because you want users to know the exact, official title of that specific form.
- It could confuse users to capitalize income taxes or income tax forms, because those phrases could refer to any number of possible forms.

See additional capitalization rules in the Specific words and phrases section.

#### Personal titles
Don’t capitalize personal titles unless they precede a name. For example, the director got approval or Director Lopez got approval. Whenever possible, keep titles gender neutral.  For example, we prefer firefighter to fireman and chairperson to chairman.

#### Headings
Headlines, page titles, subheads and similar content should follow sentence case, and should not include a trailing colon.  For example:
Making sense of Washington’s tech landscape
Privileges and responsibilities
See also: information about optimizing headings.

### Inclusive language
The words we use can make the difference between forging positive connections or creating distance in our personal and professional lives. Particularly in writing, impact is more important than intent.
As we build government services, we want to ensure they are accessible and welcoming to everyone who needs to use them.  Inclusive language helps us to be more accurate and build trust with our users.
This guidance is influenced by the Conscious Style Guide, which is an excellent resource for learning more about the conversations behind terms, categories, and concepts. Other resources we used:
- Diversity Style Guide
- Disability Language Style Guide
- Associated Press Stylebook
- Syracuse University Disability Cultural Center Language Guide

This page is not exhaustive, but aims to provide principles, resources, and specific suggestions for writing and talking about diverse groups of people.

#### Ability and disability
Every person is a whole person — no matter how they interact with the world. Focus on what they need to do, what tools they use, and avoid making assumptions.  If a person’s situation, medical condition, illness, or injury is relevant to the content, be as specific as possible and avoid inserting value judgements about their circumstance (for example, use has multiple sclerosis, not is afflicted with or suffers from).
Just like with language around race, gender, or other identities, it’s always best to ask people how they identify rather than assuming.  For help finding appropriate or accurate language, see the Disability Language Style Guide from the National Center on Disability and Journalism.
- Avoid describing people as disabled, handicapped, or confined to a wheelchair.
- Avoid terms that contribute to stigmas around disability or mental illness: crazy, dumb, lame, insane, psycho, schizophrenic, or stupid.
- Avoid terms that contribute to stigmas around sensory disabilities: blind spot or tone deaf.

#### Age
Avoid referring to someone’s age, unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing about (for example, when referring to benefits that are available to people of certain ages).
- Don’t use women or older relatives as substitute for novice or beginner.  For example, don’t say something is so simple your mother can use it.
- We prefer older person or senior to elderly.

### Gender and sexuality
Make content gender neutral wherever possible, and strive to write in a gender-fair way.  If you’re writing about a hypothetical person or if you’re unsure of the person’s pronouns, use they or them instead of he/she.
Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias, such as irrelevant descriptions of appearance.
Use descriptors of gender identity or sexual orientation as modifiers, not as nouns (for example, transgender person, cisgender person, or lesbian woman).  Avoid guessing sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.  When in doubt, either reconsider the need to include this information or ask the person you’re referring to how they identify and what terms they prefer.
- Use different sex instead of opposite sex (because this recognizes gender as a spectrum, rather than a binary).
- We support using they or their as singular pronouns.
- Avoid guys as a way to refer to mixed-gender groups.
- Don’t make assumptions about marital or family relationships (for example, use spouse or partner instead of husband and wife; use parent instead of mother and father).

For more detailed guidance, see the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association Style Guide or the GLAAD Media Reference Guide.

#### Nationality
Avoid using citizen as a generic term for people who live in the United States.  Many government programs serve non-citizens and individuals with a wide range of immigration and visa statuses.
- How you refer to the public is largely dependent on context.  Feel free to choose from any of these words:  people, the public, users, or folks.
- Be as specific as possible.  Depending on the situation, you may want to say something like people who need healthcare or people who need to access government services online.
- Use citizens for information related to U.S. citizenship, for example, when describing who is eligible to vote in federal elections.
- Be careful with Americans or the American public. These terms are ambiguous and are often used as synonyms for citizens. 

In most cases, the public is equally clear and more inclusive. That said, referring to Americans or the American people can be useful if you want to inspire readers or take a more patriotic tone.

#### Race, ethnicity, and religion
Avoid using words, images, or situations that reinforce racial, ethnic, or religious stereotypes (even stereotypes that may appear to be positive). Avoid the term non-white, or other terms that treat whiteness as a default.
Don’t make assumptions: ask how people identify themselves, and be aware of complexities within racial, ethnic, and religious identities.  For example, not all Arabs are Muslim, and many nationalities and ethnicities include various religious practices and traditions.
When referring to a person’s race or ethnicity, use adjectives, not nouns (for example, a Hispanic person, not a Hispanic).

- Religion Newswriters Association’s Religion Stylebook

### Names
#### Personal names
Use full names on first reference.  On second reference, use first names when writing about our teams or our work, and otherwise follow AP style (which is to mostly use last names on second reference).
If the context means that there’s a chance of confusion on second reference when using only first or last names, use full names.

#### State names
- Spell out state names, such as Mississippi.
- When referring to a number of states, “state” should be lowercase. For example, All 50 states responded.
- When used with a city, spell out the name of the state.  For example, Atlanta, Georgia.

### Numbers and percentages

#### Numbers
Generally speaking, we follow the guidelines outlined in the AP Stylebook.  In body copy, we prefer to spell out numbers one through nine, and use numerals for numbers 10 and greater.  This is true of ordinal numbers, as well. Spell out first to ninth, and capture 10th or greater with numerals.
Sometimes the government writes about very large numbers:  millions, billions, even trillions.  We express these numbers with a numeral and a word. For example, 1.6 million people.  When referring to amounts of money in cents or greater than $1 million, we use numerals followed by words: 5 cents or $2.7 million.  For amounts of money less than $1 million, we use the dollar sign: $17.
In titles, subheadings, and interface labels, we use numerals instead of spelling out numbers.  For example, 10 digital tech leaders you should know now or 6 ways to incorporate plain-language strategies.  We do this to promote ease of reading and scannability — in titles and headings, it’s easier for readers to scan numerals than it is for them to scan written-out numbers.

#### Dates
Use the full, four-digit year.  For informal writing, it’s okay to use an abbreviated form. For example, We’re thankful web design isn’t stuck in the ’90s.

#### Percentages
In keeping with AP style, we spell out percent in most cases, with a few exceptions. We use the percent sign (%) in these circumstances:
Tables and in technical or scientific writing.  For example: 60% of participants reported experiencing negative side effects.
Headings and subheadings.  For example: Candidate Woof takes 7% lead in the election for best dog.
Interface labels
Captions and infographics
We choose to use the percent sign in these cases to improve content’s scannability, allowing readers to digest the content more quickly.

### Punctuation

#### Bulleted lists
Capitalize the first word of every bullet.  Don’t use semicolons after points in a bulleted list.  Include a period at the end of the bullet only if that point is a complete sentence.  For example:
When you go to the store, please buy:
- Apples
- Bananas
- Naan chips

When you leave the house:
- Please buy apples, bananas, and naan chips.
- Fill the car with gas.

#### Colons
Capitalize the first word after a colon, only if what follows is a complete sentence.  For example:
I have several favorite foods:  apples, bananas, and naan chips.
I have several favorite foods:  Apples were my first favorite snack, but naan chips are a rising star in my life.
#### Commas
We use the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford comma).  In a list of three or more, include a comma before the conjunction.  For example:  Please buy apples, bananas, and naan chips.

#### Dashes
When offsetting a phrase with dashes you should use the longer em dash (—), which is Option + Shift + - on Macs, with a space on either side of the dash.  For example:
We emphasize open, digital record keeping, and — whenever possible — we illuminate our processes.
Although we advocate using words rather than symbols, in some contexts you may use an “en dash” to convey a range of numbers.  For example, both 10–20 students and 10 to 20 students are acceptable options.  En dash is Option + - on Macs.
We assign 2–3 people to each development team.

#### Quotes
These quotations are correctly punctuated:
“Would you like a banana?” he asked.
“I hate bananas,” she said. “You know I hate bananas.”
He paused before saying “bananas are not something people should hate.”

#### Spaces
Sentences should always be separated by a single space.  Never two spaces.

#### Ampersands or plus signs
Use and instead of an ampersand or plus sign, unless they’re part of an official title or company name.  For example, D.C. Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day

#### Slashes
Avoid using the slash / symbol.  Replace it with words or commas as appropriate.

### Voice and tone
If you’re like many folks, you might not be sure of the difference between voice and tone.  Maybe you’ve never deliberately crafted a voice and don’t know where to start.  Not to fret!  In this section, we’ll discuss the differences between voice and tone, how we describe our organizational voice, how to establish your own voice, and how to choose a tone that’s appropriate for whatever you’re writing.

#### The difference between voice and tone
It’s a common question and one that young writers find themselves asking often:  What’s the difference between voice and tone?
Our voice is our unique personality.  It can be helpful to think of voice as analogous to a person’s voice.  Just as you can identify your best friend in a crowd as soon as you hear her distinctive laugh, you can use an author’s or organization’s voice to identify a piece of writing even if you haven’t seen the byline.  A well-crafted voice communicates personality and values — it’s a distilled representation of an author or organization.
Tone is more like attitude — the emotional context of a piece.  It can be helpful to think of authorial tone as analogous to a person’s tone of voice.  Just as a person would use a somber, sympathetic tone of voice to console a friend about the loss of a pet, an author writing a story about a natural disaster would most likely use a somber, serious tone. Conversely, an author writing a blog post about the launch of a new product might use an enthusiastic, upbeat tone.

#### Our voice
At Defions, we like to communicate in a friendly, straightforward way. We consider our voice to be:
- Authoritative
- Conversational
- Friendly
- Instructive
- Welcoming to all audiences

We believe that government communication can — and should — be fun and easy to read, and our voice represents this.
Here are a few sentences, taken from this content guide, that exemplify our voice:
```markdown
We created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis.  It’s here when you’re wondering whether to capitalize the word federal, for instance, or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone.
```

#### Use contractions
In all of the communication we produce, we want to create a strong connection with our users.  We want to get them the information they need in a straightforward way and show that we know what’s important to them.  As a vendor for government organizations, we need to sound somewhat official; we also recognize that official doesn’t need to translate to stuffy, archaic, or aloof.
For this reason, we use contractions in the writing we create for our site.  We also encourage clients to consider using contractions, too, though we recognize this may not be the right choice for all contexts.
The government is run by people for the benefit of people, and we never want users to forget that Defions is a group of enthusiastic, dedicated, hardworking (and friendly) folks.  This desire informs how we craft our voice.

#### Establishing your own voice
Whether you realize it or not, you already have a unique voice; the tricky part can be classifying it and pinning it down.
To describe your voice — which, in turn, will allow you to diagram it, create guidelines around it, and make it reproducible — you’ll need to do some investigation and self reflection.  Ask yourself these questions:

#### What are my core values?  
Your voice is a reflection of your core values. Before you craft a voice, consider the values your organization represents and how you can translate these into stylistic patterns.  If you’re part of a young organization that hasn’t yet codified its values, you might use this opportunity to start that conversation.  Crafting a voice before you’ve determined your organization’s values can be dangerous — your voice might not reflect what you eventually decide on.  Along the same lines, if your organization is undergoing a large-scale values overhaul, you’ll want to make sure your organizational voice reflects your new values.

#### Who is my audience?  
In writing, as elsewhere, your audience is paramount — without them, you’d have no reason to write.  Put yourself in their situation and think about the stylistic traits that might appeal to them.  Remember, your voice doesn’t need to appeal to everyone (and, in fact, shouldn’t — cure-alls cure nothing, as the old saying goes).
Use your answers to these questions to craft a description of your voice. Once you’ve come up with your description, look it over and identify any contradictions or holes (never a good thing).  While voices should be nuanced, they should also be cohesive.

#### Choosing a tone
As we mentioned earlier, your voice is a constant, but your tone is a variable.  Consider the following:  If you’re having an irredeemably terrible day, you might get peeved at a store associate who chirpily (and repeatedly) asks if they can help you with anything.  Instead of picking up on your nonverbal — or perhaps verbal — cues, this associate is tone-deaf.  The associate maintained a consistently helpful voice, but they failed to shift their tone from energetic to restrained.  As a result, their message (however valuable or well-intended) is lost on you.
To avoid going the way of the associate, think about your users’ needs in different situations.  Use these needs to determine your tone.
Let’s consider three examples that target three different reader groups. Obituaries, technical blog posts, and marketing emails targeted at newly engaged couples have vastly different tones.  Why?  The three types of writing correspond to audiences in three highly different emotional states.

## NEED TO FIX
Type of writing	Intended readership	Tone	Example
Obituary of a prominent community member	People who knew (or knew of) the deceased	Respectful, reverent, somber	“Professor Pelham was respected by his colleagues and revered by students, many of whom would wake before dawn on registration day to ensure gaining entry to his classes. His wit, gentle humor, and compassion left their mark on everyone he talked to.”
Blog post announcing open source documentation guide	Developers and other readers with a strong tech background	Direct, impartial	“The Open Source Style Guide is a comprehensive handbook for writing clear, accessible, and user-friendly documentation so that your open source code repositories are accessible both internally and externally.
Marketing email from the boutique bridal department of a well-known clothing company	Newly engaged women (ages 28 through 33)	Enthusiastic, earnest, bubbly	“Say ‘I do!’ to 25% off. Now through July 3rd, take an additional 25% off all bridal wear and accessories. Celebrate your big day in style (and get a jumpstart on your honeymoon fund!).”

If you’re having trouble finding an appropriate tone, try reframing the situation:  How would you talk to a friend who’s in the same situation as your target user?  Remembering that written communication is a conversation can help you settle on the best tone for your purpose.

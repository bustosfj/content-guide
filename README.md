## Introduction
### How to use this guide
This guide was developed for colleagues of Defions Solutions. 

### Overview
This guide helps writers create content that’s easy to understand and meets people where they are.  Government websites often talk at readers rather than to or with end-users.  As with other facets of its online presence, .gov writing tends to describe the government’s concerns in “governmentese,” leaving users frustrated by information that is neither actionable nor understandable.
This guide takes that frustration into account, as well as several commonly supported guidelines about writing for the web.  Using this guide can help content designers benefit from our experience to date, incorporate user feedback into the editorial process, and build trust by communicating in a consistent manner.
### If you work at Defions Solutions
We created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis.  It’s here when you’re wondering whether to capitalize the word federal, for instance or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone.

##Our Approach
Tips and standards for developing user-centered content.
### Content principles
#### Start with user needs.
Write in a way that suits the situation. Ask yourself: Who is going to read this? What do they need to know? How might they be feeling?
Help people find the information they need quickly and easily. Guide them through the process.
#### Do the hard work to make it simple.
Use plain language and simple sentences.
Choose clarity over cleverness.
#### Write for everyone.
Respect the complexity of our users’ experiences.
Be willing to be surprised about who’s reading your work.
#### Build trust.
Talk like a person.
Tell the truth.
Use positive language and concrete examples.
#### Start small and iterate.
Make sure your content works for users. Don’t be afraid to scrap what’s there and start over.
Write a draft, test it out, gather feedback, and keep refining.

### Address the user
Content on government sites often makes a direct appeal to the public to get involved or take action.
Address the user as you whenever possible. For example:
You can email us at info@defions.ai or find us on Twitter.
Learn more about starting your account.
If you’re creating content for multiple users—such as patients and their caregivers—address the primary user as you and refer to secondary users by their roles or titles.
We recommend against using the word citizens when talking about the public.

### Avoid duplication
If something is written once and links to relevant information easily and well, people are more likely to trust the content.  Duplicate content produces poor search results, confuses the user, and damages the credibility of our websites.
If users can find two similar pieces of content on a subject, they might end up calling a helpline or sending an email to the first address they find because they aren’t sure they have the right information.
There are thousands of federal websites.  Collectively, they host hundreds of millions of pieces of content.  What are you writing about? What are other agencies publishing?  Are users across the country and the world seeing a coherent view? How are we different?
Before you publish something, check that the user needs you’re trying to address has not already been covered:
- Search for the content using a popular search engine like Google or Bing.  This is how most users will start, too.  If content is already easy to find, duplicating it can lead us to compete with ourselves for search results.
_ Often, Defions team members write about a government service, tool, or program.  Think authoritatively:  What department or agency controls the thing you’re writing about?  What information have they produced already?
- Start significant projects with a content audit.  Identify how any existing information is used and whether it will be helpful to your users in its current state.  If it isn’t, what must change for it to help you address your users’ needs?  Focus your work on those changes.

### Be concise
To keep content understandable, concise, and relevant, it should be:
- Specific
- Informative
- Clear and concise
- Brisk but not terse
- Incisive (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and unnecessary words) but human (not something generated by a faceless machine)
- Serious but not pompous or emotionless—adjectives can be subjective and make the text sound more emotive and like spin
You should:
- Use contractions (such as can’t and won’t)
- Not let caveats dictate unwieldy grammar (for example, say You can rather than You may be able to)
- Use the language people are using
- Use Google Trends to check for common search terms
- Use short sentences
- Check sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them for clarity
Words ending in –ion and -ment tend to make sentences longer and more complicated than necessary.  Avoid turning verbs into nouns, a common sign of governmentese at work.

#### Keep sentences short and sweet
Craft sentences at 25 words or fewer, whenever possible.  If a sentence has fewer than 14 words, readers understand 90 percent of content.  At 25 words, sentences are markedly more difficult to comprehend.

We also recommend varying sentence length.  Switching things up helps you keep readers interested.  This tactic will also give you better control of your content’s tone — a text with only short sentences can unintentionally sound terse.  The occasional longer sentence adds a bit of narrative interest (and can help a piece of writing sound friendlier, too).

Here’s an example of how you might transform a too-long sentence into something more manageable.  Instead of:
- Due to privacy and logistical considerations, passes cannot be replaced if lost or stolen; a new Paper Voucher must be accessed by going to the everykidinapark.gov website and completing the same activities to obtain a new Paper Voucher.
Use:
- Unfortunately, we can’t replace lost or stolen passes.  Get a new pass by visiting everykidinapark.gov and signing up again.

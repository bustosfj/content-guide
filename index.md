# How to use this guide
This guide was developed for colleagues of Defions Solutions. 

### Overview
This guide helps writers create content that’s easy to understand and meets people where they are.  Government websites often talk at readers rather than to or with end-users.  As with other facets of its online presence, .gov writing tends to describe the government’s concerns in “governmentese,” leaving users frustrated by information that is neither actionable nor understandable.
This guide takes that frustration into account, as well as several commonly supported guidelines about writing for the web.  Using this guide can help content designers benefit from our experience to date, incorporate user feedback into the editorial process, and build trust by communicating in a consistent manner.

### If you work at Defions Solutions
We created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis.  It’s here when you’re wondering whether to capitalize the word federal, for instance or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone.

## Content Types
Detailed guidance for Web and print elements

### Forms
Many of our projects involve forms — editing existing forms and creating new ones. We’ve compiled the following list of strategies to help you create forms people will find easy (and maybe even enjoyable) to complete.

#### Use an appropriate tone
Understanding how people might be feeling as they encounter your form can help you make more informed decisions about the right tone to use. Is your form associated with a high-stress experience or a more benign one? Are you requesting deeply personal, or more general, information? How might this impact people’s frame of mind?

Consider the purpose and situational context of the form you’re designing, along with the type of information you’re collecting. For example, if you’re preparing a form someone will use to secure medical services for a family member, you might use a reassuring, direct tone. If you’re designing a form folks can use to register for a professional conference, you might use a livelier, more jovial tone.

#### Start with easier questions
In addition to tone, the sequence of your form’s questions can influence the user experience it creates. Start your form with easier-to-answer questions — basic demographic information, for instance — and then work up to more comprehensive or difficult-to-answer ones. Starting with easier questions helps people ease into the experience of completing your form.

#### Provide enough context
Understanding people’s possible attitudes toward the requests you’re making can help you determine where to provide contextual information and how much to provide. If you’ll be requesting Social Security numbers, financial data, or personal medical information, you may want to share why you need this information and explain the safeguards you’ll be taking to protect it. Providing this context can help users feel more at ease and create a more satisfying interaction.

#### Design with devices in mind
We strive to design content that’s equally accessible — and enjoyable — across all devices. That said, keeping your users’ device preferences in mind can help you make decisions about form language. If you know most people will be accessing your form on mobile, consider creating shorter field labels. If most people will be accessing your form in the browser, you can create longer, more descriptive field labels without compromising the user experience.

#### Keep it concise
Brevity is especially pertinent when creating forms. People are completing your form to achieve a certain end; don’t create more work for them by using unwieldy or long-winded descriptions.

Create labels that are concise and to the point — “First name” is much easier to comprehend at a glance than “What moniker do you go by?” Short labels are also easier to read on mobile, and potentially save you money on translations.

#### Align field length with response length
Fields should be the right size for the information you’re requesting. Fields for capturing a first or a last name or a city of residence can be short; fields meant to capture longer responses — a complaint or request, for instance — should be sized so that people can see what they’re typing before submitting it.

#### Don’t use placeholder text as labels
Labels should appear above fields, not as placeholder text inside those fields. Using placeholder text as labels can create confusion around which information belongs where (it’s easy to forget what a field is for if it’s not labeled), and it can make form completion more difficult for people with disabilities.

#### Don’t make optional information required
If a piece of information is optional, tell the user. Requiring only the information that’s truly required will save your users time — something all of us can appreciate. It’s also a best practice to label only optional fields or only required fields, depending on which option is less overwhelming. For example, if your form has four required fields and one optional field, it would make more sense for you to label the optional field.

#### Follow accessibility best practices
If not designed thoughtfully, forms can present major accessibility issues. Inaccessible forms can impact a range of people — screen reader users, keyboard-only users, people with cognitive disabilities, and those who are mobility impaired, to name a few — creating unnecessary barriers. For more detailed information about how to make forms accessible, see our accessibility guide.

### Headings and titles
Most people start their search for information with a search engine. If they can’t find your page, they won’t be reading your content.

To help users find your content, you have to use their vocabulary and keywords, starting with your page title, summary, and first paragraph.

#### Find the right keywords
Use search tools like Google Trends to compare different versions of headings to see which will be more effective. What you’re calling the subject of your page might not be what your users are calling it. With Google Trends, you can input two or more different words or phrases and see over time how often people have searched for them. Generally, it’s best to use whichever phrase is used more often in your heading.

For example, the phrase extractive industries is part of the name of the U.S. EITI site, but extractive industries isn’t a familiar term for many users (and there aren’t very many searches for that term). To help make content more findable, the site includes familiar terms like natural resources, fossil fuels, and renewable energy whenever possible.

A Google Trend search shows that natural resources and fossil fuels are both more popular search terms. The page about natural resource production in the U.S. is a great example of how those terms can be included in headers.

#### Optimize the content
Once you know the most popular keywords, you can incorporate them judiciously in:

- Titles
- Headings
- Introductions and summaries
- Chapter and section titles
- Metadata descriptions

See also: information about heading capitalization.

##Images
Images are an excellent way to communicate information.

Use relevant photos, graphics, and other visual elements when they clarify what you are communicating. The same principles we apply to written content apply to images:

Address the user: Focus on illustrating or drawing attention to specific points you want them to understand.
Be concise: Don’t use numerous or complex images when one or two simple ones will do.
Be conscious: Consider how your image choices include or exclude.

###Common uses of imagery at 18F
Group pictures or images of people working together are great additions to posts about meetups, hackathons, or other events.
Screenshots can go a long way in explaining design and user experience techniques in how-to pieces.
Consider GIFs to illustrate functionality, show users a series of steps, or give examples of interactive content in a static post.
An image on the 18F blog that spans the full width of a blog post should be 1600 pixels wide, though it will only display as 800 pixels wide. If possible, use vector images in the SVG format. Full-width images that precede body copy should illustrate the theme of the full post, not just one small part. Avoid using screenshots of text above the body copy as they can be confused with the body of the post. If you’d like to use a screenshot of text, consider slightly tilting the image to the left—say, 6 degrees or so—so it is clearly separate from the body of the page. If a post includes an image that illustrates only a specific section, put that image directly before that section. When choosing images, make sure they are not so tall as to push other content off the screen. Captions for images should be directly below the image and italicized.

When floating images left or right around the text of a post, make sure the images are between 500 pixels and 100 pixels wide, but when using multiple images on the page, consider how those images might look as the text wraps on smaller screens. Make sure you test your content on a phone to ensure the images don’t impede the readability of the text.

### Copyrighted images
Government works, including both written content and images created by 18F staff, are in the public domain by default.

If you want to use existing images, check out the 18F Visual Identity Guide or explore public domain options before resorting to works under copyright. The process of publishing will be simpler, and questions of attribution will be much less confusing for the public if they choose to use our written content elsewhere. Look for images with a CC0 license.

Good places to search for public domain (CC0) images:
- USA.gov
- Flickr (select U.S. Government works or No known copyright restrictions from the top left drop down)
Wikimedia commons

If you do use copyrighted images:
- Try to find use one with few restrictions on reuse like a Creative Commons Attribution license.
- Get permission from the copyright holder.
- Attribute the photo to the source (especially if required or requested).
- Where possible, link to the source online.

### Accessibility
Images must comply with 508 standards and accessibility guidelines. The broad requirement is that any information presented in an image must also be presented in an alternative format (for people who cannot view images). While 508 compliant is the minimum threshold for our content, we generally hold our work to a higher standard specified by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines’ (WCAG) AA standard.

For images this means every image on a web page must have alt text describing the image. Additionally, any text that appears in the image must also appear in the alt text. Most screen readers already add “Image of” when reading out an image, so alt text like “Image of the 18F logo” is redundant because screen readers will read it “Image of image of the 18F logo.” A good rule of thumb is to limit alt text to 150 words, anything longer should be placed in the content of the page.

Images that serve solely to illustrate or provide visual interest for other nearby content do not require alt text, but they do require the alt attribute to be present (in code, this is done with alt=""). Otherwise, screen readers will fall back to uttering the URL of the image.

Note also that if the image is associated with an action or concept, the alt text should refer to the name of the action or concept rather than the literal description of the image. For example, if a search field has an image of a magnifying glass to signify that clicking on it will initiate a search, “Search” will be more useful alt text than “Magnifying glass”.

For more details and examples, read the 18F Accessibility Guide.

### Captions
When captioning an image, the goal is to add additional context and information. Don’t simply state what the reader is able to see by looking at the photo itself. Captions should increase depth and understanding. They are also a good place to include attribution information when images are under a Creative Commons license or other groups have granted 18F permission to use an image.

## Style guides
We often develop project-specific style guides to support our partners and their audiences. We usually call these documents content guides, because most of our partners already follow a style guide like AP, GPO, or Chicago.

### Guidelines
Here are a few things to keep in mind when you’re developing style guides:

Respect the partner’s existing style. Assume that your partner has an agency-level style guide and ask about it.

If they don’t have a style guide, start with AP since we’re most familiar with it and many of our partners use it.
If any of the existing style guidelines inhibit clarity or usability, talk with the partner about it, backing up your recommendations with insights from user research.
Keep it brief. Don’t try to document every possible grammatical or style issue. Keep your guide short and sweet so it’s easy for people to reference. Most of our guides include:
- High-level notes about voice and tone
- Usage guidelines
- Acronyms and abbreviations
- Capitalization
- Numbers
- Punctuation
- Web styling, such as headers or glossary terms

### Specific words and phrases
Focus on what’s new or particularly unique. If you’re using sentence case or avoiding acronyms, for example, call that out and include inline examples. If you need to use specific terms or technical jargon with users, include suggested phrasing to help other writers follow along.

Share and refine it. Post the guide on a wiki or in a pattern library with other project documentation — don’t bury it in a PDF. Make it easy for people to find and update the guidelines as questions come up.

Examples
- cloud.gov
- FBI Crime Data Explorer
- login.gov :lock:
- myUSCIS
- Natural Resources Revenue Data

## Technical and interface writing
At 18F, we often write technical documentation, guides, forms, and interface messages. In most of these cases, it’s safe to say the reader is learning something new or troubleshooting. These guidelines will help you write clear, concise instructions, which will provide your reader with the best possible experience.

### Basics
Do the hard work to make it simple.
Help the reader follow along. Break instructions or processes down into individual steps. Use short, simple sentences with words people use in everyday conversation.

Refer to navigation labels, buttons, and menus as they appear in the app or website. Verify the spelling and capitalization as you write. Be specific.

Instead of:
Open a new meeting invitation.

Use:
In Google Calendar, click Create.

#### Direct the reader.
Start your sentences with active verbs or clear objectives.

Instead of:
Help us understand what kind of help you need by creating an issue in GitHub.

Use:
Create an issue with details about your request.

Or:
To get started, create an issue in GitHub with details about your request.

Focus on what the reader can do rather than what they can’t. (This is known as using positive language.)
Instead of:
You cannot continue without signing in.

Use:
Sign in to continue.

### Guidelines

#### Titles and headings
Be consistent with how you phrase titles. If your guide or tutorial has several pages, stick to the same naming convention for scannability, such as:

Nouns: Policies, Teams, Offices
Verbs: Create an account, File a report, Download our data
Use sentence case for headings. (If you’re writing articles for the 18F Handbook or 18F Pages, the table of contents will auto-generate based on your <h2>, <h3>, and <h4> tags or Markdown headings.)

#### Introduction
Include a short two- or three-sentence summary about the document to help the reader confirm whether they’re in the right place, and improve search engine indexing.

#### Code
Use backticks to style text and code snippets readers may want to copy and paste. For example:

Use the legend element to offer a label within each form element.

Copy and paste mkdir /home/foo/doc/bar && cd $_ into Terminal.

In the first example, legend is an HTML element and should be styled as code. “Element” is a technical concept and shouldn’t be marked up as code. “Label” is both a concept and an HTML element but is used here in the former sense and should not be styled as code.

Do not capitalize code elements, even at the start of a sentence, unless the term is capitalized in the code itself.

Use fenced code blocks for multi-line code snippets, and specify the language to enable syntax highlighting on GitHub:

In JavaScript, to get the current value of a select element with an id of mySelect, use this:

var el = document.getElementById("mySelect");
var value = el.options[el.selectedIndex].value;
Use straight quotes within code blocks rather than curly (or smart) quotes.

CODE-LIKE ELEMENTS
The same rules apply to pieces of text that must be used exactly as presented, such as passwords or Wi-Fi network names:

someCl3v3rN4me is the name of our Wi-Fi network.
Your password is PleaseChangeMeSoon.

Interface elements
Use clear verbs to tell readers how to interact with interface elements:

Choose from drop-down menus.
Select or deselect checkboxes and radio buttons.
Click or tap buttons.
Follow or open links.
In the 18F Handbook, we emphasize the name of the interface label like so:

In the File menu, choose Save.
Select I agree.
Click Continue.

#### Tables
Tables are generally suitable only for data: two or more “objects” (rows) that share two or more “values” (columns). In tables, column widths are the same for all rows, which can make them easier to scan visually. Tables are easily navigable for sightless users so long as the content is organized in a logical way. Here are some other guidelines to consider:

When listing numbers, it’s good practice to align them to the right of their cell, with the same decimal precision (“40.50” and “1.00”) so that the numbers are easier to compare while scanning.
Always align column headings up with the values in the columns. For example, numeric column headings should be aligned right if the values are, too.
Links and additional resources
It’s rare that a document lives on its own. Tell people where to go for help if they have questions.

For documentation and guides, you might say:

For more information, see the 18F Code of Conduct.

Still have questions? Ask in #newcomers.

If your work relates to several other documents, pick the most important ones or gather the links in a section at the bottom.

##Trademarks and brands
Avoid using a trademark unless you’re referring to a specific product.

This can be tricky when a trademarked name, like Kleenex, has become synonymous with an entire family of products. Try to use a generic word — like tissue — instead of a brand name.

- Common trademarked words (with alternative terms)
- Band-Aid (adhesive bandage, bandage)
- Bubble Wrap (packaging bubbles)
- Chapstick (lip balm)
- Crayola (crayons)
- Dumpster (waste container, trash container)
- Hi-Liter (highlighting marker)
- iPod (MP3 player)
- Kleenex (tissue)
- Plexiglas (plastic glass)
- Post-it note (adhesive note)
- Q-Tips (cotton swabs)
- Scotch tape (transparent tape)
- Styrofoam (plastic foam)
- Taser (stun gun)
- Xerox (photocopy, copy)

### Guidelines
Careful use of trademarked names and brands is important because the government shouldn’t endorse specific brands or products. When writing about corporate brands or products to illustrate a point, mention a range of related companies instead of a single provider. For example:

Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube can help you connect with users.

Avoid linking to products or services, because people can see it as an endorsement. The same rule applies to the brands and products of individuals, such as personal websites or websites where you can buy their book. Do link to useful resources, like slide decks or how-to guides, from private individuals or companies. If you mention a trademark, capitalize and punctuate it in the trademark holder’s preferred style.

## URLs and filenames

### Creating URLs
URLs should be short, memorable, easy to type, and well-structured. Your control over your URL may be limited, but you should do what you can with the pieces you can control.

In the vast majority of cases, everything a user can reach on your site should have a distinct URL that a user can bookmark and use later to reach that same location.

When creating URLs, use dashes to separate words, omit articles (a/an/the), use the stems of verbs (/make-thing/ rather than /making-thing/), and avoid extraneous terms.

### Domains
Domains should reflect the user’s needs and not those of the organization. If your department is several layers deep in terms of bureaucratic structure, it’s unlikely that this is important to users, and there is likely minimal cost associated with using a more shallow domain.

It’s not necessary to have www. at the start of a domain. This is a holdover from the early internet. Any domain that has a www level should also work if that level is omitted.

Domains should not be more than three levels deep in most cases: 18f.gsa.gov is fine, but content-guide.guides.18f.gsa.gov would not be. It’s rare that more than four levels is justifiable.

At the same time, it’s not necessary to have a two-level domain for everything.

Domain names should be short, using abbreviations unless those are likely to be meaningless to users.

If a domain level has more than one word, you should strongly consider separating the words with dashes to make sure users read them the way you intend. If 18F had a project called EARS that for some reason needed a two-level domain, that domain should be 18f-ears.gov and not 18fears.gov (ears.18f.gov would probably be the ideal).

Domains are case-insensitive. They should be written as lowercase.

### Paths
Again, the shorter the better, but long paths are more excusable than long domains.

Paths are typically understood as hierarchies that become increasingly specific: /content-guide/urls-and-filenames/ reflects that urls-and-filenames is part of content-guide. If this were a much larger guide, it’s possible that it could be divided further, for example /content-guide/urls-and-filenames/creating-urls/.

Each level of a path should make it possible to find the content beneath it:

The content at the root level should reflect that /content-guide/ is present.
/content-guide/ should make it easy to find urls-and-filenames/.
Conversely, the user should be able to remove a level from the path and end up at the parent of the original content.

Paths should be designed to be sensible for the user, not to reflect internal technical or bureaucratic structure. For example, filename extensions like .php should be avoided as they reflect the internal technology used on the server (and will not reflect even that if the site later changes to a different technology).

When separating words in a path, use hyphens. Hyphens are commonly understood by search engines to indicate word breaks (whereas other separators, like underscores, are not).

Paths are case-sensitive. They should be lowercase, regardless of what they contain, as uppercase letters make them more difficult to type (and to remember).

Examples
DOMAIN NAMES
Starting point: www.longnamecreationservice.departmentoflongnames.bureauofnames.gov.
Slight improvement: longnamecreationservice.departmentoflongnames.bureauofnames.gov.

Rationale: www is unnecessary and omitting it makes the URL easier to type.

Very slight improvement: long-name-creation-service.departmentoflongnames.bureauofnames.gov.

Rationale: Hyphens make the URL easier to read. The same would be true for the other levels of the domain, but we’re assuming you don’t have control over those in these examples.

Improvement: long-name-creation-service.bureauofnames.gov.

Rationale: The user doesn’t need the URL to reflect that the service belongs to the Department of Long Names.

Better: lncs.bureauofnames.gov.

Rationale: This is shorter and easier to type. However, it relies on users thinking of the service by that abbreviation.

Better: make-long-names.bureauofnames.gov.

Rationale: If the users aren’t familiar with that abbreviation, a shorter description of what the service does is better to have as the lowest level of the domain.

PATHS
Starting point: /services/default/php/forms/departmentoflongnames/longnamecreationservice/index.php?action=create.
Slight improvement: /services/default/php/forms/departmentoflongnames/longnamecreationservice/index.php.

Rationale: Assuming that creation is the most likely action users will want to take, make it the default and strip the requirement for the query string.

Slight improvement: /services/default/php/forms/departmentoflongnames/longnamecreationservice/.

Rationale: The default page should be delivered automatically, making the inclusion of index.php unnecessary. Also, hide the technical details (.php).

Improvement: /departmentoflongnames/longnamecreationservice/.

Rationale: Users don’t need to know the technical setup of the site.

Improvement: /department-of-long-names/long-name-creation-service/.

Rationale: Words should be separated with hyphens.

Better: /department-of-long-names/lncs/.

Rationale: As above, if the users are familiar with the abbreviation, use it to make the path shorter.

Better: /department-of-long-names/make-long-names/.

Rationale: As above, if they aren’t familiar with the abbreviation, use a shorter description of what the server does.

BOTH
Starting point: www.longnamecreationservice.departmentoflongnames.bureauofnames.gov/services/default/php/forms/departmentoflongnames/longnamecreationservice/index.php?action=create.
Improvement: make-long-names.bureauofnames.gov/department-of-long-names/make-long-names/.

Rationale: This combines the suggestions from the previous two sections.

Better: make-long-names.bureauofnames.gov.

Rationale: This is reasonable if the Department of Long Names has only a couple of services that might be popular enough to warrant their own subdomains, particularly if they don’t necessarily fit cleanly into other content and stand alone.

Better: bureauofnames.gov/department-of-long-names/make-long-names/.

Rationale: This is reasonable if the Long Name Creation Service is one of many related services that the Department of Long Names provides.

Maintaining URLs
Users constantly bookmark and share web pages, making the maintenance of permanent and long-lasting URLs an important piece of content management. Broken links obscure the internet landscape.

URLs should never stop working.

This is not as technically challenging as it sounds. If the domain — the high-level domain, not subdomains — is lost, the URLs will be lost, but otherwise it’s entirely possible to keep them working. Planning for them to continue working is the first step in any process that involves new URLs.

Whenever possible, maintain original URLs. In all other cases, set up a redirect for outdated URLs and links; this is almost always a painless task for web managers. There are a variety of ways to accomplish this, some of them requiring more technical work than others. It’s most difficult to accomplish when moving from URLs that include query parameters, as some early website systems did. Sensibly-constructed URLs are easier to migrate.

Some examples:

Changing subdomains
If we changed our name from 18F to 19G, we would change our domain, so this page would be located at https://pages.19g.gov/content-guide/urls-and-filenames/. We would keep the 18f.gov domain running, but all it would do would redirect everything to 19g.gov. Users who entered the old URL would be redirected and might not even notice the URL change.

If we decide to eliminate the pages subdomain and put this directly on 18f.gov, we would do essentially the same thing, keeping this subdomain and adding a rule to redirect to the same path on 18f.gov.

Changing paths
If we produce lots and lots of content in the future, it might become sensible to change our path to reflect this, and we might want to have a guides level, so that the new URL for this page would be: https://pages.18f.gov/guides/content-guide/urls-and-filenames/. In this case, we would add a rule that redirects everything starting with /content-guide/ to /guides/content-guide/.

This also means that URLs, and parts of URLs, should not be re-used. Once we use /content-guide/ to refer to this guide, we can no longer decide in future to use /content-guide/ as the location for something else, even if we later change the URL for this guide.

Creating filenames
Use hyphens to separate words, just as with URLs.

Lowercase is better, because it’s easier to type and to remember.

Use the right extension — PDFs should have .pdf at the end, JPGs should have .jpg at the end, etc.

Shorter is better, but the content should be descriptive to the user, and it’s better to have long descriptive filenames than short obscure ones. summary-of-pay-gap-findings.pdf is better than paygap.pdf or smmrypgpfnds.pdf.

If the file content is based on a date or time, include that: the 1998 report for an organization should have 1998 in the filename, a February issue of a magazine should have the year and the month, and a PDF of a daily newspaper should have year, month, and date. When including dates, use the YYYY-MM-DD format, i.e. 2015-10-13.

Avoid the use of special characters beyond the hyphen and period, unless absolutely necessary. Do not include spaces (use hyphens in their place).

Presenting URLs and filenames in text
Whether beginning with the protocol or not, always lowercase URLs in text. Paths are case-sensitive, however, so their casing must be preserved.

In interactive contexts, particularly web pages, URLs (except when used as examples, as throughout this document) should always be active links. When they’re active links, do not include the protocol in the link text.

In non-interactive contexts, such as print, the protocol can be omitted, assuming http:// and https:// both work and bring the user to the same place.

There are occasions where URLs should be delimited; use < and > for this. This is not normally necessary in interactive contexts where the link is clearly defined, but is most often relevant in email, where the writer may have to guess at what their email program will turn into a link. This is particularly true when URL contains spaces.

Filenames are case-sensitive, and their case should be preserved when they are referred to in text; do not capitalize if beginning a sentence with a filename that begins with a lowercase letter. Filenames may need to be delimited in the same way as URLs.

Examples
Capitalization on a web page:

gsa.gov is the General Services Administration site.

Capitalization in print:

gsa.gov is the General Services Administration site.

Delimiting an awkward URL in email:

When you get the chance, could you redirect <example.com/spaces in URLs are bad/> to <example.com/spaces-in-urls-are-bad/>, as per our guidelines, and make the latter the definitive URL for the page?

URL Structure
The protocol. For example https://, http://, or ftp://. The :// is always present.
The domain. For example 18f.gsa.gov. This is “where on the internet” the URL is referring to. Also called:
site
domain name
server
Optional: the port. A number specifying how to access the content on this particular domain. Not normally used on production sites. Follows the domain, separated by a colon, for example http://dev.example.com:8080.
The path: what resource on the domain the URL is referring to. If omitted, defaults to /, the “root level” of the domain. Always starts with a slash, and different levels of resources are separated by slashes. For example: /content-guide/ is the path in https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/.
Optional: the query string. Normally contains parameters that have been submitted to the site, for example with searches. ?q=18f+content+guide is the query string in https://www.google.com/search?q=18f+content+guide.
Optional: the fragment. Normally this indicates a specific section of a page, but can also be used for other things by web applications. #main is the fragment in https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/specific-words-and-phrases/#main.
The protocol should almost always be https:// unless you’re forced to use http://. Users entering http:// as the protocol should be redirected to https://. If at all possible, your URL should not contain a port. Query strings should also be avoided. Fragments can be used as a helper for the user, but should not be necessary for the user to find the relevant content.

Link text
It’s important to remember that users of screen readers will often skip from one link to another, skipping the text in between, as a way of skimming for the content they need.

This ultimately means that link text should be understandable independent of the text surrounding it. Avoid ambiguous link text like click here, here, or learn more whenever possible.

For example, instead of:

Click here for more information about our Code of Conduct.

Use:

For more information, see the 18F Code of Conduct.

This has an added benefit of improving search results for sighted users.

Screen reader-only text
In some situations, descriptive links may be overly verbose or redundant for sighted users. Here’s an example from the betaFEC site:

betaFEC screenshot

Here the Learn more link is appropriate for sighted users, but it may be confusing to screen reader users. In such situations, it’s possible to add invisible text just for screen reader users. For example, the U.S. Web Design Standards has a special CSS class called usa-sr-only for this purpose. Using this class, the aforementioned Learn more link might be written in HTML like so:

<a href=”essentials-house-and-senate-candidates-and-committees/”>
  Learn more
  <span class=”usa-sr-only”>
    about candidate and candidate committees
  </span>
</a>
This would keep the link concise for sighted users, while also providing important context for screen reader users.

If you want to use text intended only for screen readers on your project but are unfamiliar with CSS, ask your project’s front end developer for help. They can create a CSS class for you if one doesn’t already exist. Alternatively, reach out to #g-accessibility or #g-frontend in Slack!
